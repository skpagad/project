        <h2>Escape Velocity</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; color: black;">Escape velocity is the minimum velocity required for an object to break free from the gravitational pull of a
        planet and enter space.
        It is an important concept in space exploration,as rockets must achieve escape velocity to leave the Earth's
        atmosphere and enter orbit or travel to other celestial bodies.
        The exact amount of energy required to escape the gravitational pull of a mass-bearing object is known as the
        escape velocity. Since everything has mass, everything has a
        gravitational pull that can be measured. Consider a deep well (referred to as an energy well by physicists) as a
        good analogy for escape velocity. You need enough energy
        to climb out of the well if you are at the bottom and wish to get out (escape). You will need to use more energy
        to reach the top of a well that is deeper than you think.
        If you just have the strength to ascend halfway, you will inevitably descend to the bottom.
        The escape velocity is a method of calculating the exact amount of energy required to reach the well's lip while
        having no energy left over to walk away.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; color: black;">The formula for escape velocity depends on the mass and radius of the planet, as well as the distance from the
        center of the planet at which the object starts.
        The calculation of escape velocity is based on the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the
        total energy of an isolated system remains constant.
        In the case of an Earth-rocket system, we assume that the system is isolated, and that the sum of the initial
        kinetic and potential energy of the rocket is equal
        to the final kinetic and potential energy when it reaches escape velocity.
